# sudoku solver (AC3, Backtracking, Forwardchecking)
This project consists of an interface representing the sudoku board where the user will have the option to load up an existing Sudoku from a TXT file (I have provided 4 examples) or to create one by selecting the numbers that will populate each cell. Once the sudoku is loaded up, the user will have the option to play for himself or to execute one of the three algorithms, if the answer is correct, it will show up on the screen.

-Backtracking

-AC3: In order to view this algorithm in action, you must execute the program from the command line, as the output of the domains will be through the console.

-Forward checking

The recursive calls and the elapsed time for each of the algorithms is also measured and will be shown through the console.
Try and call backtracking and forward checking algorithms before and after calling AC3 to see how the recursive calls and time taken change with the reduction of the domains.

For any question, feel free to contact me.
